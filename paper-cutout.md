name: Paper Cutout
essence: "Hand-cut layers of colored paper with real shadows and fiber texture. Warm, tactile, storybook craft."

typography:
  display: ["Fraunces", "Recoleta", "DM Serif Display"]
  body: ["Nunito", "Quicksand", "Source Sans 3"]
  rules: "Soft serif display, rounded sans body. Sentence case, friendly sizes."

texture_technique:
  - "Elements have slightly irregular hand-cut edges (subtle wobble, 1–2px)"
  - "Each layer casts a soft paper shadow (0 3px 6px rgba(0,0,0,0.15), tight)"
  - "Visible paper grain overlay at 3–5% opacity"
  - "Layering: 3–5 depth levels maximum"

layout:
  grid: "Loose organic placement on a light grid; slight rotations (-2° to 2°) allowed."
  spacing: "Comfortable, never cramped; layers need room to cast shadows."
  frames: "Torn or deckle-edged paper strips as section separators."

motion:
  style: "Gentle stop-motion feel: 8–12fps jitter on hover, layers lift toward the viewer (shadow grows)."
  duration: base
  forbid: [glass-blur, neon-glow, slick-easing]

imagery:
  treatment: "Cut-paper illustration only. Photography must be treated as printed cutouts with white cut borders."
  signature_prompt: "paper cutout craft illustration, layered colored construction paper, soft shadows between layers, visible paper texture, hand-cut wobbly edges, warm matte palette, storybook style, top-down studio lighting"

components:
  buttons: "Paper slab: colored rounded-md with paper shadow; press = shadow collapses (button presses INTO page)."
  cards: "Layered paper sheets, top sheet rotated -1°."
  badges: "Tiny washi-tape strips holding elements."

dos:
  - "Build scenes from layers: background hills → mid objects → front characters"
  - "Keep edges imperfect but consistent in wobble scale"
  - "Use shadow tightness to communicate layer distance"
donts:
  - "No gradients or glass effects — paper is matte"
  - "No photorealistic 3D"
  - "No more than 5 layer depths or it turns muddy"
