id: bauhaus
name: Bauhaus
essence: "Form follows function. Primary colors, pure geometry, and typography as the hero. The original design system."
mood: [rational, bold, optimistic, systematic]

palette:
  bg: "#F4F1EA"            # warm paper white
  ink: "#141414"
  primary: "#D22730"       # bauhaus red
  secondary: "#1D4E9E"     # bauhaus blue
  accent: "#F2B705"        # bauhaus yellow
  note: "Black + white + at most TWO primaries per view. Never all three plus more."

typography:
  display: ["Archivo Black", "Space Grotesk", "Archivo"]
  body: ["Inter", "Archivo", "Work Sans"]
  rules: "Grotesque only. Heavy display weights. Type may be rotated 90° as a structural element. Numbers huge and proud."

texture_technique:
  - "Circle, triangle, square as compositional actors"
  - "Flat color blocking, hard edges, zero gradients"
  - "Visible grid; elements snap to it audaciously"
  - "Occasional diagonal axis (30°/45°) for dynamism"

layout:
  grid: "Exposed asymmetric grid. Overlap shapes with type deliberately."
  spacing: "Compact blocks separated by large white fields."
  frames: "No decorative borders — color blocks ARE the frame."

motion:
  style: "Geometric choreography: shapes slide, snap, rotate 90°. Mechanical, precise."
  duration: base
  forbid: [blur, soft-shadow-drift, elastic-bounce]

imagery:
  treatment: "Flat geometric illustration or black-and-white photography cropped into circles/triangles."
  signature_prompt: "bauhaus poster composition, flat primary colors red blue yellow on off-white, large geometric circle triangle square, bold sans-serif typography, 1920s modernist graphic design, flat vector, no gradients"

components:
  buttons: "Solid primary rectangle or circle. Hover = hard swap to another bauhaus color. No shadows."
  cards: "White on paper, one geometric shape attached, 2px black border optional."
  nav: "Black bar or bare type row; active item gets a color block."

dos:
  - "Make one geometric shape the star of each section"
  - "Use type as a shape (crop it, rotate it)"
  - "Keep everything flat"
donts:
  - "No gradients, no shadows, no rounded softness beyond radius-sm"
  - "No pastel versions of the primaries"
  - "No decoration that doesn't structure"
pairs_with: [geometric-abstract, brutalism]
