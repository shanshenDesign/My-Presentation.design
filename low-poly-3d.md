id: low-poly-3d
name: Low-Poly 3D
essence: "Faceted worlds with flat-shaded charm. Friendly dimensionality — 3D without the uncanny valley."
mood: [playful, optimistic, modern, approachable]

palette:
  bg: "#EAF4FB"            # sky-tinted white (or "#141B2E" for night scenes)
  scheme: "Analogous gradient families: each object picks 3–5 neighboring hues for its facets."
  suggested: ["#7EC8E3", "#5AA9D6", "#F7B267", "#F4845F", "#95D5B2", "#6C8EBF"]
  note: "Facets of one object = slight value shifts of one hue. Scene-wide palette stays analogous (warm OR cool dominant)."

typography:
  display: ["Space Grotesk", "Sora", "Outfit"]
  body: ["Inter", "Nunito Sans"]
  rules: "Geometric sans, medium-bold. Clean UI sits ON TOP of the 3D world, never textured by it."

texture_technique:
  - "Flat-shaded triangular facets; NO smooth shading"
  - "Soft ambient occlusion between objects"
  - "Single directional light + gentle sky fill"
  - "Isometric or slight-elevation camera for scene illustrations"

layout:
  grid: "UI on a clean grid; 3D scenes as hero islands (rounded-2xl containers or full-bleed backdrops)."
  spacing: "Product-standard spacing; the 3D provides the personality."
  frames: "3D scenes in soft containers with radius-lg, floating on clean background."

motion:
  style: "Gentle idle animation: floating bob (±4px), slow rotation. Scroll = camera dolly through the scene."
  duration: base
  forbid: [jitter, texture-noise, dark-grit]

imagery:
  treatment: "Low-poly 3D renders (Blender/Three.js style) or isometric facet illustrations."
  signature_prompt: "low poly 3d render, flat shaded faceted geometry, soft pastel analogous colors, isometric scene, cute minimalist landscape or object, soft directional lighting, clean render, blender style, gentle ambient occlusion"

components:
  buttons: "Clean solid fills (product-UI standard) — the 3D lives in imagery, not controls."
  cards: "White/5% tint cards with soft shadow-md; a tiny low-poly icon adds charm."
  icons: "Miniature low-poly objects instead of line icons where budget allows."

dos:
  - "Keep facet count low and silhouettes readable"
  - "Light every scene from one direction"
  - "Contrast playful 3D with crisp, professional UI text"
donts:
  - "No smooth/realistic shading mixed with facets"
  - "No photorealistic textures on poly models"
  - "No busy scenes behind body text (contrast law)"
pairs_with: [geometric-abstract, memphis]
